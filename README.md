# hugo-homebrewery-theme_props

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Module that builds on top of [Hugo-Homebrewery](https://github.com/tnarik/hugo-homebrewery) to provide a set of "assets" (called "props" here to avoid confusion with Hugo's `assets` folder) so that they can be added to a Hugo Theme.

This is NOT a full Hugo Theme but instead provides a reduced set of partials and templates (including an 'adventure' archetype that can be overriden) to be used in conjunction with other themes.

It DOESN'T provide global theme (navigation bars, headers, etc) but it just focuses on allowing for the theming of specific portions of pages such as the main content.
